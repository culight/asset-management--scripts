Automated Asset Extraction/Injection Scripts

Overview
_________

    These scripts allow the developer to automatically pull assets out of their original folders
    and inteo an Excel document. The user can modify or remove an asset in the excel sheet and the appropriate
    injection script can be used to automatically make the changes in the original folder.

    The high-level objective of these scripts is to allow quick and easy replacement of old content with new
    content. They encourage generic, easily readable naming conventions and also consolidate the assets, making
    them easier to manage.


Setup
_____

    This script was developed and tested using Python 2.7.10 on a Mac. To get setup with python,
    I would recommend the following approach:

    - Open Terminal

    - Install Homebrew
        $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

    - Insert Homebrew in your PATH variable
        in your home directory:
        - vi .profile
        - Add the following line: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

    - Install Python using Homebrew
        $ brew install python

    - Install pip
        $ sudo easy_install pip

    - Install Virtual Environment
        $ pip install virtualenv

    If any issues arise or if you would like more details, please visit the following link for reference:
    http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/

    Once these resources are setup, you should be able to run the script as described in the examples below.


Usage
______

    Extracting images:

        Instructions:
            1. Find the path to the project folder where images will be extracted

            2. Run the extraction script:

                python image_extraction.py -i path/to/image-folder/ -o name-of-excel-doc

                * If you provide no output, the name of the output folder will be the path's base name by default.

            3. An output directory will be created in your project directory with the path
               "asset-management/images/folder-name/"


        Example:
            python image_extraction.py -i Users/rmoton/MobileProjects/iOS/ios-project/src/asset-folder/Images/

            All of the images in the Images/ path will be copied over to the excel spreadsheet with their corresponding
            metadata. Each separate folder with images will be exported to a different spreadsheet.
            This excel document along with a "replaced" and "source" folder will be created in a new directory
            within the parent directory of the Images/ path (i.e. ...ios-project/src/asset-folder/asset-management/).
            This will be the working directory for the injection script.

            The name of the excel document will automatically be set to the name of the folder from which it extracts
            (i.e. for Images/ it will be "Images.xlsx"). You may specify a different name for the excel document by
            including a -o tag followed your desired name.

        Known Issues/Concerns:
            - If the script encounters multiple files with the same name, it will acknowledge the first occurence
            - The script is designed to parse through directories with multiple folders,
              but has problems with single folders
            - I've run into a corrupt image files before that causes the script to crash


    Injecting images:

        Instructions:
            1. Run the extraction script (if you haven't already) and the Excel document will be auto-created

            2. In the excel doc, take note of which images you want to replace or remove

            3a. If you want to remove an image write "remove" in the source name column of the spreadsheet

            3b. If you want replace an image with an image of a different name, type the name of the new image
                in the source name column

            3c. If you want to replace the image with an image of the same name, leave the source name image blank

            4. Add your new images to the source folder in the working directory
                (i.e. ...ios-project/src/asset-folder/asset-management/source/)

            5. Run the injection script:

                python image_injection.py -i path/to/asset-management/ -e name-of-excel-doc

                * -e flag is only needed if the name of the excel doc is different from the base name of the path

            6. Images in the "source" folder will replaced with the current images, and current images will
               be sent to the "replaced" folder - double-check the results

            7. To update the excel document, re-run the extraction script

        Example:
            python image_injection.py -i Users/rmoton/MobileProjects/iOS/ios-project/src/asset-folder/asset-management/

        Known Issues/Concerns:
            - Hidden bugs


Next Steps
___________

- Add the string extraction/injection script
- Allow for extraction from a single folder
- More testing and feature discovery
- Possibly integrate Photoshop Api to process batch edits
